## Disclaimer :warning:

**TerraPrime**: Optimized for Next-Gen Capabilities! :rocket:

- :computer: **High-End Requirements**: Primarily developed with Unreal Engine's Nanite and Lumen technologies in mind, TerraPrime is tailored for mid-to-high range systems.
- :construction: **Nanite in Experimental Stage**: Features involving Nanite, especially tessellation, are currently experimental. Full functionality is anticipated around Unreal Engine versions 5.6 or 5.7.
- :x: **Known Limitation**: The significant unresolved issue at present is the integration of Runtime Virtual Texturing (RVT) with Nanite object blending.

Stay tuned as we continue to enhance and expand TerraPrime's capabilities for the cutting edge of landscape design! :telescope:

## Overview :mag:

TerraPrime is a revolutionary landscape automaterial and procedural content generation (PCG) plugin for Unreal Engine 5.4+, designed to automate the texturing process and enable the seamless blending of terrain layers. With features like Nanite support and Lumen integration, TerraPrime pushes the boundaries of realism in virtual worlds, making it an essential tool for next-gen game development and virtual environments.

### Key Features :sparkles:

- **Seamless UE 5.4+ Integration**: Optimized for Nanite and Lumen.
- **Landscape Layers**: Dirt, Cliff, Grass, Snow, Beach, Seabed, and customizable Paint Layers.
- **Advanced Material Techniques**: Distance variation, macro variation, and cell bombing for lifelike textures.
- **Height-defined Layer Blending**: Ensures natural transitions between terrains.
- **New in 0.4.0**: Added edge noise and additional RGB noise masks for texture variation.
- **New in 0.3.0**: Added support for ambient occlusion and dynamic control over Nanite tessellation at runtime.
- **C++ Classes and Blueprint Nodes**: For advanced control over features like Nanite tessellation.
